## üîë Foundational Concepts

### 1. Credentials
Proof of identity; can be:
- Knowledge-based (passwords)
- Possession-based (tokens)
- Inherence-based (biometrics)

**Advanced Concepts:**  
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Standardized, tamper-proof digital credentials in W3C DID framework.  
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):** Users fully control their digital identity and data.

### 2. Digital Signatures
Cryptographic schemes proving authenticity and integrity.  
**Example:** ECDSA signs Bitcoin transactions.  

- **Pros:** Non-repudiation, integrity check  
- **Cons:** Public identity revealed  

### 3. X.509 Certificates (PKI)
Digital certificates linking a public key to an identity.  
**Example:** HTTPS certificates issued by Certificate Authorities.  
- **Cons:** Centralized trust; compromised CAs = fraudulent certs.

### 4. Claims
Assertions about identity (e.g., `"is a student"`).  
- **Standard:** JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure claim transfer.

### 5. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
Hybrid system for encrypting/signing emails.  
- **Cons:** Hard for non-technical users ‚Üí low adoption.

### 6. Confidentiality & Anonymity
- **Confidentiality:** Data only accessible to authorized parties (AES/TLS).  
- **Anonymity:** Hiding who is communicating (Tor, Mixnets).

### 7. Mixers / Tumblers & CoinJoin
- **Mixers/Tumblers:** Centralized crypto transaction shuffling.  
- **CoinJoin:** Decentralized aggregation of multiple transactions.

### 8. Privacy Techniques
- **CoinShuffle:** Improved decentralized CoinJoin  
- **Stealth Addresses:** One-time addresses for every transaction  
- **Dandelion Protocol:** Network-level transaction privacy  
- **Pseudonymity:** Consistent pseudonyms for accountability

### 9. Signature Schemes
- **Ring Signatures:** Prove membership in a group without revealing sender  
- **Group Signatures:** Group member signs on behalf of group; traceable by manager  
- **Blind Signatures:** Sign without knowing message content (e-cash)

### 10. Confidential Transactions
- **CT (Confidential Transactions):** Pedersen commitments hide amounts  
- **RingCT:** Monero hides both sender and amount  
- **Bulletproofs:** Efficient zero-knowledge range proofs

### 11. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
Prover convinces verifier a statement is true without revealing it.  
- **Types:** Interactive & Non-Interactive (NIZKs)  
- **Variants:** zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, zk-Rollups, zkCP

### 12. Advanced Cryptographic Functions
- **Homomorphic Encryption (HE):** Compute on encrypted data  
- **Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing:** Split secrets into shares  
- **Threshold Signatures:** Group-based signing  
- **PRF / OPRF:** Pseudorandom functions, oblivious variants

## üîê Cryptographic Primitives & Protocols

### 1. Encryption Schemes
- **Symmetric (AES, ChaCha20):** Fast, bulk data  
- **Asymmetric (RSA, ECC):** Key exchange, signatures  
- **Hybrid:** Asymmetric for keys, symmetric for data (TLS)

### 2. Hash Functions
- SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE3  
- Integrity verification, password storage (with salt), HMACs  
- Avoid MD5/SHA1

### 3. Digital Signatures
- RSA-PSS, ECDSA, EdDSA  
- Used in JWTs, software signing, blockchain transactions

### 4. Key Exchange
- Diffie-Hellman, ECDH  
- Authenticated variants prevent MITM  
- Ephemeral keys (DHE/ECDHE) ‚Üí forward secrecy

---

## üåê Network Security & PETs

### 1. TLS/SSL
- Encryption + HMAC + certificates  
- Use TLS 1.2+ (prefer 1.3), disable weak ciphers

### 2. VPNs
- Encrypted tunnels for confidentiality, integrity, and IP masking  
- Protocols: OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPSec

### 3. TOR & Mixnets
- Onion routing hides sender/receiver identities  
- Mixnets batch/delay/shuffle messages for stronger anonymity
